There are 11 attributes
1)id : id number
2)age: age in years
3)sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
4)cp: chest pain type
-- Value 0: typical angina
-- Value 1: atypical angina
-- Value 2: non-anginal pain
-- Value 3: asymptomatic
5)trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
6)chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
7)fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
8)restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
9)thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
10)exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
11)oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
12)num: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease
